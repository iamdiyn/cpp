Optional: Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer,who is trying to win championship belts for various weight 
categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

    *It should ask him what his earth weight is.
    *Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
    *It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:


# 	Planet 	Relative Gravity

*1 	Mercury 	 0.38
*2 	Venus 	   0.91
*3 	Mars 	     0.38
*4 	Jupiter 	 2.34
*5 	Saturn 	   1.06
*6 	Uranus 	   0.92
*7 	Neptune 	 1.19
